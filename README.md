# React Native FlatList Empty List Bug

This repository demonstrates a common bug in React Native where a FlatList component fails to render data even after successful API fetching.  The issue lies in how the component handles data updates and rendering.  The provided solution clarifies best practices for ensuring proper data display in FlatLists.

## Bug Description

The `DataList` component fetches data from a JSONPlaceholder API endpoint.  The data is successfully fetched and stored in the component's state, but the `FlatList` remains empty. The error handling is in place but isn't triggered, even though there is no data being rendered.
